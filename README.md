# CVE-BOT
Cve-bot is a Discord bot designed to provide the latest CVEs in your own server.

It has two basic commands: **/latest** and **/detail CVE-ID**, where CVE-ID is the id of the CVE that you wish to
know the details of.

Right now, it is under development, and the functionalities are very basic, but here is a 
brief TODO list to let you know what to expect from this project:

### Roadmap for CVE-BOT

- [x] Implement the /latest command
- [x] Implement the /detail command
- [ ] Implement service to feed the latest CVEs every 6 hours.
- [ ] Implement a service to alert about the latest CVEs that have over 9 in score.
- [ ] Set up a customized alert system for individual users.

### SETUP

To be able to create your own CVE-BOT, all you have to do is clone this repository with the following 
command:
```console
git clone https://github.com/romeuu/cve-bot.git
```
This command will clone this repository into your computer.

The next thing you have to do is duplicate the config_example.json file and rename it to config.json,
here you will save the sensible data of your own application, like clientId, guildId, or the Api Key.

This bot consumes the nvd.nist.gov CVE API (https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0).

Documentation: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities. 

Request an API KEY right here: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

After this, all you have to do is do a npm install, to be able to install the packages needed for it to work.
```console
npm install
```

Finally, you are all set. All you should do is execute the index.js file with the following command:
```console
node index.js
```
Or you could use nodemon (https://nodemon.io/), to be able to have a hot reload feature in the app.

If you liked the bot, please consider giving it a star.
